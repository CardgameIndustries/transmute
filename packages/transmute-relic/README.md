# Transmute Relic

A TypeScript Library for Transmute Contracts

#### TODO


Store methods which take adapter map must now take an adapter class which contains the map and implements a type conversion interface....


### Commands:

`yarn contracts:replace && yarn test ./src/__tests__/SolidityTypes/`

Useful when testing contacts. This will delete and migrate contracts via truffle and save the ABIs. 
The ABIs are then used to generate typescript classes, which are used in tests...
