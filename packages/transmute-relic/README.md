# Transmute Relic

A TypeScript Library for Transmute Contracts

#### TODO

Implement convenience interfaces for Store + Factory.

use InternalTypes in reducer.

refactor modules / Utiles/ Types locations...

add encryption support to adapters...

fix or remove permissions stuff...

implement fullstack demo... again.

### Commands:

`yarn contracts:replace && yarn test ./src/__tests__/SolidityTypes/`

Useful when testing contacts. This will delete and migrate contracts via truffle and save the ABIs. 
The ABIs are then used to generate typescript classes, which are used in tests...
